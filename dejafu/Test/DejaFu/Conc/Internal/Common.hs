-- * The @Conc@ Monad

-- | The underlying monad is based on continuations over 'Action's.
--
-- One might wonder why the return type isn't reflected in 'Action',
-- and a free monad formulation used. This would remove the need for a
-- @AStop@ actions having their parameter. However, this makes the
-- current expression of threads and exception handlers very difficult
-- (perhaps even not possible without significant reworking), so I
-- abandoned the attempt.
newtype M m a = M { runM :: (a -> Action m) -> Action m }

instance Functor (M m) where
    fmap f m = M $ \ c -> runM m (c . f)

instance Applicative (M m) where
    -- without the @AReturn@, a thread could lock up testing by
    -- entering an infinite loop (eg: @forever (return ())@)
    pure x  = M $ \c -> AReturn $ c x
    f <*> v = M $ \c -> runM f (\g -> runM v (c . g))

instance Monad (M m) where
    return  = pure
    m >>= k = M $ \c -> runM m (\x -> runM (k x) c)

#if MIN_VERSION_base(4,9,0)
    fail = Fail.fail

instance Fail.MonadFail (M m) where
#endif
    fail e = cont (\_ -> AThrow (MonadFailException e))

-- | The concurrent variable type used with the 'Conc' monad. One
-- notable difference between these and 'MVar's is that 'MVar's are
-- single-wakeup, and wake up in a FIFO order. Writing to a @MVar@
-- wakes up all threads blocked on reading it, and it is up to the
-- scheduler which one runs next. Taking from a @MVar@ behaves
-- analogously.
data MVar m a = MVar
  { _cvarId   :: MVarId
  , _cvarVal  :: C.CRef m (Maybe a)
  }

-- | The mutable non-blocking reference type. These are like 'IORef's.
--
-- @CRef@s are represented as a unique numeric identifier and a
-- reference containing (a) any thread-local non-synchronised writes
-- (so each thread sees its latest write), (b) a commit count (used in
-- compare-and-swaps), and (c) the current value visible to all
-- threads.
data CRef m a = CRef
  { _crefId   :: CRefId
  , _crefVal  :: C.CRef m (Map ThreadId a, Integer, a)
  }

-- | The compare-and-swap proof type.
--
-- @Ticket@s are represented as just a wrapper around the identifier
-- of the 'CRef' it came from, the commit count at the time it was
-- produced, and an @a@ value. This doesn't work in the source package
-- (atomic-primops) because of the need to use pointer equality. Here
-- we can just pack extra information into 'CRef' to avoid that need.
data Ticket a = Ticket
  { _ticketCRef   :: CRefId
  , _ticketWrites :: Integer
  , _ticketVal    :: a
  }

-- | Construct a continuation-passing operation from a function.
cont :: ((a -> Action m) -> Action m) -> M m a
cont = M

-- | Run a CPS computation with the given final computation.
runCont :: M m a -> (a -> Action m) -> Action m
runCont = runM

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- * Primitive Actions

-- | Scheduling is done in terms of a trace of 'Action's. Blocking can
-- only occur as a result of an action, and they cover (most of) the
-- primitives of the concurrency. 'spawn' is absent as it is
-- implemented in terms of 'newEmptyMVar', 'fork', and 'putMVar'.
